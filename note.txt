newly discovered runtime error

11. cursor cannot accept empty array 


info 
1. new limit/limitToLast clause will override old limit/limitToLast clause in query
2. new cursor will override old cursor <-- no longer true, it actually works
3. serverTimestamp is possibly null if it haven't resolved https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47771044/firestore-timestamp-getting-null
4. firestore cannot store Nan and undefined

limitation
1. unable to union object type with other type except possibly undefined <- not exactly limitation but something that you shouldn't do
3. no autocomplete for where's value.
4. working with documentId and where require to assert the value as const.
5. no Record<number, any>
