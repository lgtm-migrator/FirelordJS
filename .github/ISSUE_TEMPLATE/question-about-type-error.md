FirelordJS is a sophisticated type checking library, despite it is designed to be easy to learn (similar API to the official SDK), the library will complain over the slightest type error (that is the whole point: extreme type safety)

people may have a hard time trying to figure out what triggers the error and how to solve

some errors require you to have a comprehensive understanding of Firestore or Typescript or both

we understand that not everybody can dig into every detail, so you can open an issue requesting clarification on how to solve certain errors

All we need to know is:
1. your Meta Type
2. code that triggers the error (you don't need to include a bunch of code, simply include one particular line that has an error)
