FirelordJS is the only library that capable of providing insane type safety while exposing almost all the API of the original Firestore SDK.

FirelordJS has:

- The lowest learning curve (API is nearly identical to the original API).
- The lowest technical debt (easiest to revert to the original API).
- The best type safety\*\*.
- The only library that capable of type against runtime errors.
- Effortless solutions for [Firestore quirks](https://firelordjs.com/highlights/about).
- Possibly also the smallest.

It is what you are looking at: the Master of Fire.

Support [@firebase/rules-unit-testing and emulator](https://firelordjs.com/tests)

What is tested in CI:

- Development code: check logic correctness
- Built code: check compiler setting
- Published code: check package.json entry point

\*\* I am confident it has the best type safe and nothing come close to it. Since I am claiming it is the best, I will put money in my words and I will buy you [x cups of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) if you:

1. found something better: 50 cups
2. created something better: 500 cups

## Contribution

(The lower it goes, the harder it is)

1. For starter, you can refactor files in `src/types` folder, especially `src/types/queryConstraintLimitation.ts`.

2. Simplify type logic and remove dead code.

3. Speed up the test like cache Firebase Tools in Github Action.

4. Utilizing the latest Typescript feature, like [extends Constraints on infer Type Variables](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#extends-constraints-on-infer-type-variables) to reduce code length.

5. Cover more tests, currently need more cursor and limit tests.

6. You can also work on the [documentation](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc).

7. Looking for a challenge? Then you can try to implement `mandatory field type`:

   - It is a special type that assign (with union) to object member.
   - Members with such type become `required` even in `update` operations(all members in update operations are partial by default).

   Practical usage is something like `updatedAt` member that keep track of document last updated time.

   Basically just turn an optional member into a required member but due to inner complexity, this is not going to be easy.

   If you want to work on this, come to me first to discuss the implementation strategy, I will provide all information you need to carry out this commit.

8. Support tuple and Record<number, unknown> type.

9. Or just spread the word. üôÇ

## Why Not Merge Firelord, FirelordJS and FirelordRN?

The idea behind merging is code reuse and reduce maintenance, but there are technical reasons that make merging a terrible idea.

1. V8 and V9 do not share the same behavior. One example is V9 `arrayUnion` and `arrayRemove` able to accept empty array argument, but this is not possible in V8 and will result in runtime exception. To solve this we need extra code for V8 wrapper thus the logic become dead code in environment that use V9 wrapper. This is not a big deal, it adds negligible amount of code, but what it tells us is, we cannot assume V8 and V9 are the same.

2. Mutually exclusive APIs. For example admin is more powerful and has APIs like `create`, `getAll` and `listCollections`; while web has cache related APIs like `getDocFromCache`, `getDocFromServer` and `enableIndexedDbPersistence`. It is not possible to export everything.

3. Mutually inclusive API with platform dependent parameter. For example, admin's `delete` and `update` has extra parameter: `precondition` while web's `onSnapshots` has `snapshotListerOptions` parameter and `documentSnapshot.data` has `snapshotOptions` parameter. Even though we can ignore those parameters under the hood if it runs in the irrelevant environment, developer would still able to see it via type hint or JSDoc, which can be confusing.

4. FirelordJS wraps V9 into type safe V9 and Firelord wraps V8 into type safe V9. So the wrapping logics are different, which mean merging will add significant amount of code.

5. Both libraries import original types from original SDKs to keep internal type safe. If we merge both library, then we would have 2 set of original types.

6. Some tests are also different, for example FirelordJS need to test against `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` but Firelord don't have to.

So that is why merging could do more harm than good in this case, especially point 2 and 3 which are detrimental to developer experience. Firelord is not simply a copy and paste of FirelordJS, there are a lot of details need to be taken care of.

One of the core principal of the libraries is to preserve originality, if we went for absolute unified interface, then we need to give up a lot.

TLDR: they look the same, but they are not the same.

As for FirelordRN:

7. FirelordRN is similar to V8 interface, thus it utilizes Firelord runtime wrapper. But since it is client side, it utilizes the interface of FirelordJS (however some parameters is missing, like `Document.Snapshot.data` method is missing parameter `SnapshotOptions`, which make it similar to Firelord instead because admin also doesn't have this parameter.). So FirelordRN is a mix of Firelord and FirelordJS, with its own quirks (@react-native-firebase/firestore also seem to mess up the `Query` type).
